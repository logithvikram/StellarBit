# StellarBit
My own Crypto token bulid on ERC20

The code you have shared is a Solidity smart contract that creates a new ERC20 token called StellarBit with the symbol "BIT". 
ERC20 is a standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, 
which allows tokens to be transferred and interacted with by other contracts and applications.

The contract inherits from the ERC20 contract provided by the OpenZeppelin library, 
which provides a secure and tested implementation of the ERC20 standard. 
The constructor function of the StellarBit contract sets the name and symbol of the token.

To deploy this contract, you will need to compile the Solidity code using a Solidity compiler, 
such as the one provided by Remix, 
and then deploy the compiled bytecode to the Ethereum network using a tool such as Remix .

After the contract has been deployed, you can interact with it using a wallet or a dApp that supports ERC20 tokens. 
You can transfer tokens to other Ethereum addresses, 
or allow other contracts to interact with your token by approving them to spend your tokens on your behalf.
